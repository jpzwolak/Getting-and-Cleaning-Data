# Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains my solution to the project assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by the Johns Hopkins University on the Coursera platform.

It contains three files, named according to the project requirements.

*	`CodeBook.md` where I describe the variables, data and my work that I performed to clean up the data.
*	`run_analysis.R` where I present the code that I wrote to clean up the data. In order to run this code one has to on their own computer one has to change the working directory (change `setwd("your path here")`) and install the plyr package (`install.packages("plyr")`).
*	`averages_data.txt` where the output of the code is saved.
